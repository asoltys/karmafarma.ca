    <p>Home-cooked, delicious, nutrient-dense meals that adhere to the paleo diet.</p>

    <p>
      We are embarking on our first year of farming on our organic, multi-locational urban farm, Yummy Yards.  We already have a few of our own winter harvests on the menu.  Look out for more Yummy Yards crops on the menu as the growing season really takes off this spring!  All other ingredients are sourced as locally, organically and ethically as possible (usually from small farms in the Lower Mainland, Fraser Valley and on Vancouver Island).

<h2>Delivery</h2>

<p>
Deliveries will be made every Tuesday between 9am and 12pm.  At this time, we can only deliver to Richmond and Vancouver.  It is your responsibility to refrigerate your meals upon delivery or leave a cooler with ice packs in it at the delivery spot you indicate.   All food is designed to stay fresh in the refrigerator for at least 3 days.  Many of the meals freeze well and are marked to indicate this, so if you don't eat them within the 3 days, you can pop them in the freezer and eat them later.  Please reheat the food to a temperature of 74C (165F) before eating.  All food will be delivered in recyclable or compostable containers. 
</p>


<h2>The Paleo Diet</h2>

<p>
A paleo diet excludes grains, dairy, legumes, refined sweeteners, high omega-6 vegetable oils and other processed foods.   Plenty of vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, seeds and nuts are eaten instead.  This diet would be suitable for many elimination diets and my hope is that people will use this opportunity to help them explore their own food intolerances or simply to incorporate more nutrient-dense foods in their diet to see how it makes them feel.  These meals will be lower in carbohydrates and higher in saturated fat than what many people are used to eating, but I believe this is actually a much healthier way to eat.</p>

<h2>Other Questions and Answers</h2>

<h3>Can you accommodate my allergies or other food restrictions?</h3>

<p>I likely can.  Please email me regarding your allergies and/or restrictions and I will let you know if I will be able to accommodate them.  Please note that I list the ingredients for the meals on the order page.</p>

<h3>What cooking oils do you use?</h3>  
<p>
Organic grass-fed butter or ghee, organic coconut oil are the main cooking oils I use.  The only other cooking oil I occassionally use is organic extra-virgin olive oil and only for low temperature cooking. 
</p>

<h3>What about the oils in your salad dressings?</h3>

<p>Extra virgin olive oil is the main oil I use for salad dressings.  I also use sesame oil to flavour Asian salad dressings.  If mayonaise is used it's always homemade with avocado oil.  I do not use high omega-6 vegetable oils, such as canola oil, sunflower/saflower oil, soybean oil or corn oil.  

<h3>Do you make your own soup stock?</h3>
<p>
Yes, I do. I make my chicken and beef stocks by slow cooking the bones in water and call these bone broths.  The only other ingredients besides the bones and water are apple cider vinegar and possibly onions, garlic, carrots, celery and herbs.  Bone broths are a good source of calcium.  They are also rich in the amino acid glycine, which is often lacking from our diets that tend to be high in muscle meat.
</p>

<h3>What sweeteners do you use?</h3>

<p>Sometimes I use fruit and juice fresh-squeezed from fruit to sweeten my meals a touch and on the rare occassion I use some honey, but never more than a teaspoon per serving and this is indicated on the ingredients list.</p>

<h3>Why do you label some of your meals “Low Carb”, “Low FODMAP” and “Autoimmune Protocol Approved”?</h3>

<p>Low carb diets can help people lose weight, lower their insulin levels and lower their blood sugars, which is good for most people, including diabetics or people at risk of becoming diabetic.  A low carb diet is often defined as getting 10-15% of your calories from carbohydrates.  If I have labeled a meal “Low Carb” it contains under 20 grams of carbohydrates.  This should keep most people within their daily low carb diet limit.  If you are of the male sex, taller, more muscular, or quite active, you may require more carbs than this, even on a low carb diet.</p>

<p>Low FODMAP diets are gaining more attention for helping people with irritable bowel symptoms (i.e. bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation).  If I have labeled a meal “Low FODMAP” it does not contain any foods higher in FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols).  FODMAPs are bascially the sugars in wheat, rye, barley, milk, legumes and certain fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>The Autoimmune Paleo Protocol is a stricter version of the paleo diet, in which nightshade fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds and sometimes eggs are also avoided.  This diet is often followed by people who have an autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis, and want to see if this stricter diet will improve their symptoms.  </p>

<p>I am not cooking for enough people at this time to provide enough options to cater to each of these more restricted versions of the paleo diet, but I wanted to give people an idea of what else is out there that may be of benefit to them in the future. </p>

<h3>Isn't it unhealthy to eat saturated fat?</h3>

<p>
It's true that since the 1950s there have been a widespread public health campaigns persuading people to eat less saturated fat to avoid heart disease and stroke.  In fact, Canada's Food Guide still supports this message, even though this recommendation was based on poorly done studies from many decades ago.  Better designed studies have since been done and these do not support the hypothesis that saturated fat causes heart disease and stroke.
</p>

<p>
However, many people's doctors still tell them that they have to eat less saturated fat to lower their cholesterol to avoid cardiovascular disease.  This is even what I told my patients less than a year ago when I was still practicing family medicine.  I have since found out that the connection between cholesterol levels and heart disease is seriously being questioned by the scientific community.
</p>

<p>
Even if there is a solid connection between cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease, saturated fat intake does not affect most people's cholesterol levels anyways. For those people that it does effect, higher saturated fat intake tends to raise both the “bad” cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) and the good cholesterol (HDL cholesterol). Further complicating things, people who eat less saturated fat tend to replace these calories with carbohydrates and vegetable oils that are high in omega-6 fatty acids. There is a lot of research indicating that these vegetable oils may contribute to a number of health problems, including heart disease.  Carbohydrates cause their own issues with the blood cholesterol panel, tending to raise triglycerides and make LDL cholesterol particles smaller, both of which are markers for heart disease risk. So, if your doctor is telling you to eat less saturated fat to lower your cholesterol or to take a statin drug, I would instead recommend that you try the paleo diet for 3-6 months and then re-test your cholesterol panel to see where you're at.  Or perhaps you could decide not to worry about your cholesterol at all and focus on things that you know are going to improve your health, like eating less processed foods, eating more nutrient-dense whole foods, being more active, getting more sleep and reducing the stress in your life.

<h3>Wouldn't it be better to eat a vegetarian diet?</h3>
<p>
I have been a vegan, a lacto-ovo vegetarian and a pescaterian at times in the past.  I no longer think it's possible to be healthy on a vegan diet.  There are too many nutrients missing that must be supplemented for, and even then, many people are poor converters of these plant-based nutrients to the active forms needed by the human body.  I do think it's possible to be healthy as a lacto-ovo vegetarian and a pescatarian, but I have found it difficult not to overeat carbohydrates on these types of diets.  The high protein and fat and low carbohydrate content of meat makes it both satisfying and satiating.  </p>

<p>Since I have started farming, I realize that nature does not produce male and female offspring in the appropriate ratios as required for egg and dairy production on the farm.  In raising laying hens or dairy cows, many unneeded male chicks and calves are born and these animals inevitably end up on the farmer's dinner plate.  Livestock on the farm, such as pigs and chickens, eat up kitchen scraps and extra or spoiled milk, in addition to producing manure to fertilize the crops .  Sheep do well ranging on hilly, rocky terain not appropriate for agricultural use.  Pastured cows can sequester carbon in the soil with well-managed grazing.  </p>

<p>So, for now I continue to eat meat.  I know that there is not enough meat in the world to feed all humans the amount of meat I currently eat, but I also know that food scarcity and food waste is a bigger issue than I can solve with my own diet.  I feel healthiest by including meat in my diet and I am commited to raising some of my own meat and to supporting other local farmers who integrate raising livestock into the holistic management of their farms.
