  name: 'Turmeric Chicken and Mushroom Stir Fry with Cauliflower Rice (Low Carb)'
  description: 'Inspired by the multifaceted flavours of Vietnamese cooking, the mushrooms and chicken take on warm notes from turmeric, acidity from vinegar and lime, and fresh sweetness from green onions and dill.

You need to take 2-3tsp of turmeric daily to harness its anti­inflammatory benefits and eating it with some fat and black pepper increases its absorption.'
